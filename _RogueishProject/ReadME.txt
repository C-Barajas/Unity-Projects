Project_1:

**Updated**
- GDD & TDD are sumbitted and pushed!!!

- Project is missing main menu & Game Logo 
- Splash Screen ready to go

Controls:

- Move with 'W,A,S,D'
- Replenish health with 'Q'
- Replenish mana with 'E'
- Cycle weapons with 'hotBar 1-4'
- Attack with 'arrow keys'
- Pause menu 'esc'
- Open/Close Inventory with "I"
- Enter/Exit shopping Chest with "K"

- Interact with inventory and shopping chest with mouse


Known Bugs so Far:

- Sometimes character will randomly get stuck while moving along a wall
- Some instances shopping chest blocks only way through dungeon/map, so I allowed character to walk through shopping chest instead
- Only happened twice when I was playing with sound effects, but when entering a new dungeon game would freeze.( **I believe this is fixed**)
- The sound/audio toggle option in the pause menu works when playing through the Unity editor, but not when you build & run the game.
- When you first spawn, sometimes it will say you have a healthPotion x1, but you actually don't.
